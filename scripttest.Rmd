Let's see whether scripts run in markdown the way I think they do.

```{r test}


knitr::read_chunk('scripttest.R')


```

Let's run this code.

```{r test-a}



```

Text to break up the chunks.

```{r plot}

xy = read.csv("xy.csv")

ggplot(xy, aes(x, y)) + geom_point()

```

Here's some text to mark the end of the document.
