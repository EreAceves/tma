##### Packages

Options for installation and updates are hashed out. Packages are checked out in a batch through lapply().

gg3d - a package for graphics in 3 dimensions - requires installation from Github through devtools.

If you're interested in a better option for package handling, learning packrat would be neat, but hasn't paid off so far.

```{r pkg_ins, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

rm(list=ls())

# Check out knitr for knitr::read_chunk.
library(knitr)

# Name packages.
pkg <- c("readr",
         "knitr",
         "tidyverse",
         "gapminder",
         "sandwich",
         "broom",
         "stargazer",
         "cowplot",
         "kableExtra",
         "reshape2",
         "devtools")

# Install packages.
#install.packages(pkg, verbose = FALSE, quiet = TRUE)
#devtools::install_github("AckerDWM/gg3D")
  
# Update packages.
#update.packages(pkg, verbose = FALSE, quiet = TRUE)

####Objective: Step through optimal aggregate harvest in an open access fishery.
1. Build a toy model for tests and demos.
2. Replicate INAPESCA's population model. 
3. Adapt methods to a 10-year forecast.
4. Add price-sensitive effort under open access.
5. Parameterize the model over historic recruitment, stock, and catch data.

##### 1. Totoaba Model

 * Each component requires specification of a function from available data and existing models.
  + Right now, each component is specified as a vector, which is convenient but not adequate for what we're doing.
  + Turning everything into functions, or keeping things as functions instead of vectors, is the next step for more complex loops.

* Build a matrix of numbers at age by year.

```{r age_struct_tma_mat}

# Matrix of numbers at age by year.
mat_a = matrix(nrow = 50, ncol = 27)

```

* Build an initial age structure - numbers at age - for the population, using INAPESCA's lower estimate for 2017 biomass and True's function for a stable age structure.
+ Consider testing True's function against a longer simulation.
+ PUT YOUR LATEX FUNCTIONS FOR TRUE'S FUNCTION IN HERE

```{r age_struct_tma_ninit}

# Vector for initial n at a.
#  Assign initial biomass from INAPESCA estimate.
#  Try the lower bound on the 95% CI of INAPESCA's 2017 estimate from surveys.
biomass_init = 25709000 # kilograms.

#  Assign functional form for frequencies at age from True (2018). See notes on symposium presentation. Check whether curve describes numbers at age.
#fun_a_n = function(a){121.99 * 10 ^ (-0.214 * a)}
# Alternative distribution for tests.
fun_a_n = function(a){121.99 * 10 ^ (-0.05 * a)}

#  Convert numbers at age to sums of weights at age to work from total biomass back to numbers at age.
fun_a_l = function(a, linf, k, t0){l = linf * (1 - exp(-k * (a - t0)))} # INAPESCA (2018): 200, 0.155, -0.65. See notes for alternatives.
fun_l_w = function(a, l, b){w = a * l ^ b} # INAPESCA (2018) / Anda-MontaÃ±ez et al. (2013): 0.000005, 3.0635. See notes for alternatives.

# Calculations:
#  Vector of ages.
a = seq(0, 26)
#  Vector of lengths.
l = fun_a_l(a, 200, 0.155, -0.65)
#  Vector of weights.
#w = fun_l_w(0.000005, l, 3.0635) This is a wrong thing that makes your numbers bad and wrong.
w = fun_l_w(0.000004128, l, 3.24674) # This is a right thing that makes your numbers good and right.
#  Numbers at age.
afreq = fun_a_n(a)
#  Weights at age.
wfreq = afreq * w
#  Weights at age, but useful.
winit = wfreq * (1 / sum(wfreq)) * biomass_init
#  Numbers at age to seed the model. That wasn't so hard, right?
ninit = winit / w
plot(ninit)

```

* Build survival (i.e. 1 - F) at age. It's constant, so it's not really exciting.
+ PUT THAT LATEX FUNCTION THAT RETURNS A CONSTANT MORTALITY IN HERE

```{r age_struct_tma_natmort}

# Vector for proportional natural mortalities at age. NB: Survival, not mortality. From INAPESCA (2018) / Cisneros-Mata et al. (1995).
v_mort = rep(0.78, 27)

```

* Build poaching mortalities at age from INAPESCA data. 
+ Instead of using numbers from 2016 - 2017, sums by age are taken over all years of sampling for a higher *n*.
+ Whether this is the best option is open to debate and guidance from advisors.
+ The function fit to mortalities-at-age is a Weibull probability density function. Others might work better. This one was chosen from eyeballing and Google.
+ PUT YOUR LATEX FUNCTIONS IN HERE

```

* Build bycatch mortalities at age from INAPESCA data.
+ These are proportions at age, but since INAPESCA's data is a narrow spread around one year of age, it's easiest to just make bycatch a proportion of juveniles at one age.
+ This needs fixing if we increase resolution to months.

```{r age_struct_tma_bycmort}

# Value for proportional bycatch mortalities at age.
bymort_init = 80000 # INAPESCA (2018) - estimated for 2011 - 2017 by some sort of credible method, probably.
bymort = 1 - bymort_init / ninit[2] # Instead of distributing bycatch mortalities, we concentrate them on one age (1) for lack of length-at-age resolution.

```

* Build proportional fecundities at age from INAPESCA estimates of maturation and egg production by weight.
+ PUT YOUR LATEX FUNCTIONS IN HERE

```{r age_struct_tma_fec}

# Vector for proportional fecundities at age. From INAPESCA (2018) / Valenzuela-QuiÃ±onez (2014).
#  Set function.

#  Get values corresponding to vector of weights - this works out to be egg production at age before accounting for maturation.
